# DES Encryption Project for CRYPTOGRAPHY uni course

In this project, we were given three texts that contained two ciphers. The first text (*text.pdf*) contains information on how to decipher the second text (*screen.pdf*), which is DES ECB encryption and reveals how the third and last text is deciphered. *paper2.pdf* is a text that has been encrypted with the Vigen√®re cipher and then with DES CBC encryption.
